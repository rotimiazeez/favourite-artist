        Westlife are an Irish boy band, which was formed 1998 in Sligo, Ireland.
        They disbanded in 2012 and reunited in 2018. They were originally signed
        by Simon Cowell in the UK, Clive Davis in the US and managed by Louis
        Walsh and Sonny Takhar.[3] The group currently consists of Shane Filan,
        Markus Feehily, Kian Egan, and Nicky Byrne. They have a total of
        thirteen major album releases, twelve of which are studio albums. Five
        albums are as a five-piece and eight are as a four-piece. The group rose
        to fame with their debut international self-titled studio album,
        Westlife (1999). It was followed by Coast to Coast (2000), World of Our
        Own (2001), Unbreakable â€“ The Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (2002), and
        Turnaround (2003), which continued the group's success worldwide. Before
        the start of their Turnaround Tour in 2004, one of the original members,
        Brian McFadden, departed from the band. The four remaining members
        continued as a group to release their cover albums Allow Us to Be Frank
        (2004) and The Love Album (2006) and the studio albums Face to Face
        (2005) and Back Home (2007). After a hiatus of studio recording for
        almost one year in 2008, they regrouped and released the studio albums
        Where We Are (2009), and Gravity (2010), and the compilation album
        Greatest Hits (2011). After eight years, the quartet group released
        their eleventh studio album, Spectrum, in 2019.
